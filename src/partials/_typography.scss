We use a browser context of `16px` or `1em` as the default font size. We use our aesthetically appealing and friendly DINPro font. 

To abide by our css styleguide, we avoid tying styles to a html element e.g `.heading h1`. With that in mind, we use classes to style headings and paragraph text.  

### Headings

```html_example

<h1 class="h1"> This is Heading 1 </h1>
<h2 class="h2"> This is Heading 2 </h2>
<h3 class="h3"> This is Heading 3 </h3>
<h4 class="h4"> This is Heading 4 </h4>
<h5 class="h5"> This is Heading 5 </h5>
<h6 class="h6"> This is Heading 6 </h6>

```

### Paragraph

```html_example

<h2> Regular </h2>
<p>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.	
</p>

<h2> Strong </h2>
